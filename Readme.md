# Vision

Visium is an AI-powered strategy assistant that transforms scattered discussions and fragmented notes into a structured knowledge base. By connecting everyday conversations to organizational goals, it helps teams and individuals see further into the future, align on priorities, and steer decisions with clarity. The long-term vision is to build a dynamic company brain that continuously learns, adapts, and keeps organizations strategically aligned.

# Mission

Our mission is to turn fuzzy thoughts into actionable, structured, and realistic knowledge. Instead of static folders or disconnected documents, Visium captures statements, decisions, and objectives in a way that reflects the real complexity of an organization—even if that organization is just one person. The focus today is on providing a simple pipeline that makes unstructured input immediately usable and meaningful.

# MVP

The MVP focuses only on the simplest flow: paste raw text → split into candidate statements → review each as flashcards (accept, edit, decline) → store accepted statements with category (past knowledge, present situation, or future objective), tags (manual or AI-suggested), and dates (created date and happening date). No advanced learning or integrations yet—just the minimal pipeline that shows this process working end-to-end.
